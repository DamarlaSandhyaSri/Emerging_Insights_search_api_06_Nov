Credit: CSRAI / Penn State It doesn\\'t take technical expertise to work around the built-in guardrails of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, which are intended to ensure that the chatbots operate within a set of legal and ethical boundaries and do not discriminate against people of a certain age, race or gender. A single, intuitive question can trigger the same biased response from an AI model as advanced technical inquiries, according to a team led by researchers at Penn State. \"A lot of research on AI bias has relied on sophisticated \\'jailbreak\\' techniques,\" said Amulya Yadav, associate professor at Penn State\\'s College of Information Sciences and Technology. \"These methods often involve generating strings of random characters computed by algorithms to trick models into revealing discriminatory responses. \"While such techniques prove these biases exist theoretically, they don\\'t reflect how real people use AI. The average user isn\\'t reverse-engineering token probabilities or pasting cryptic character sequences into ChatGPT—they type plain, intuitive prompts. And that lived reality is what this approach captures.\" Prior work probing AI bias—skewed or discriminatory outputs from AI systems caused by human influences in the training data, like language or cultural bias—has been done by experts using technical knowledge to engineer large language model (LLM) responses. To see how average internet users encounter biases in AI-powered chatbots, the researchers studied the entries submitted to a competition called \"Bias-a-Thon.\" Organized by Penn State\\'s Center for Socially Responsible AI(CSRAI), the competition challenged contestants to come up with prompts that would lead generative AI systems to respond with biased answers. They found that the intuitive strategies employed by everyday users were just as effective at inducing biased responses as expert technical strategies. The researchers presented their findings at the 8th AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society . Fifty-two individuals participated in the Bias-a-Thon, submitting screenshots of 75 prompts and AI responses from eight generative AI models. They also provided an explanation of the bias or stereotype that they identified in the response, such as age-related or historical bias. The researchers conducted Zoom interviews with a subset of the participants to better understand their prompting strategies and their conceptions of ideas like fairness, representation and stereotyping when interacting with generative AI tools. Once they arrived at a participant-informed working definition of \"bias\"—which included a lack of representation, stereotypes and prejudice, and unjustified preferences toward groups—the researchers tested the contest prompts in several LLMs to see if they would elicit similar responses.

Credit: CSRAI / Penn State \"Large language models are inherently random,\" said lead author Hangzhi Guo, a doctoral candidate in information sciences and technology at Penn State. \"If you ask the same question to these models two times, they might return different answers. We wanted to use only the prompts that were reproducible, meaning that they yielded similar responses across LLMs.\" The researchers found that 53 of the prompts generated reproducible results. Biases fell into eight categories: gender bias; race, ethnic and religious bias; age bias; disability bias; language bias; historical bias favoring Western nations; cultural bias; and political bias. The researchers also found that participants used seven strategies to elicit these biases: role-playing, or asking the LLM to assume a persona; hypothetical scenarios; using human knowledge to ask about niche topics, where it\\'s easier to identify biased responses; using leading questions on controversial topics; probing biases in under-represented groups; feeding the LLM false information; and framing the task as having a research purpose. \"The competition revealed a completely fresh set of biases,\" said Yadav, organizer of the Bias-a-Thon. \"For example, the winning entry uncovered an uncanny preference for conventional beauty standards. The LLMs consistently deemed a person with a clear face to be more trustworthy than a person with facial acne, or a person with high cheekbones more employable than a person with low cheekbones. \"This illustrates how average users can help us uncover blind spots in our understanding of where LLMs are biased. There may be many more examples such as these that have been overlooked by the jailbreaking literature on LLM bias.\" The researchers described mitigating biases in LLMs as a cat-and-mouse game, meaning that developers are constantly addressing issues as they arise. They suggested strategies that developers can use to mitigate these issues now, including implementing a robust classification filter to screen outputs before they go to users, conducting extensive testing, educating users and providing specific references or citations so users can verify information. \"By shining a light on inherent and reproducible biases that laypersons can identify, the Bias-a-Thon serves an AI literacy function,\" said co-author S. Shyam Sundar, Evan Pugh University Professor at Penn State and director of the Penn State Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence, which has since organized other AI competitions such as Fake-a-thon, Diagnose-a-thon and Cheat-a-thon. \"The whole goal of these efforts is to increase awareness of systematic problems with AI, to promote the informed use of AI among laypersons and to stimulate more socially responsible ways of developing these tools.\" More information: Hangzhi Guo et al, Exposing AI Bias by Crowdsourcing: Democratizing Critique of Large Language Models, Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (2025).

Research identifies eight distinct bias categories—including gender, race, age, disability, and appearance-based discrimination—creating potential claims for discriminatory harm, defamation, and regulatory violations under employment law, consumer protection statutes, and emerging AI governance frameworks. Business interruption and reputational risks materialize when biased outputs generate negative publicity or trigger product recalls, while compliance exposures intensify as regulators increasingly scrutinize AI systems for fairness and transparency. The inadequacy of current mitigation strategies (output filtering, user education) suggests organizations face heightened E&O and product liability claims if biased responses cause financial, reputational, or legal harm to end users or third parties. Underwriters should require comprehensive bias testing protocols, robust output governance controls, and documented AI governance frameworks as conditions for coverage, with particular attention to organizations serving regulated industries (finance, healthcare, employment) where algorithmic discrimination carries elevated statutory penalties.",

In early June 2024, a significant flood affected Southern Germany. While the top row shows the floods obtained from the GloFAS reanalysis, the bottom row shows the river discharge forecast by our approach. The severity of floods is categorized by the statistical flood return period, i.e., occurring every 10 years. Credit: arXiv (2025). DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2505.22535 Extreme weather events such as heavy rain and flooding pose growing challenges for early warning systems worldwide. Researchers at the University Bonn, the Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ), and the Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have developed RiverMamba, a new AI model that can predict river discharges and flood risks more accurately than previous methods. The research team will present its findings on December 4 at this year\\'s NeurIPS 2025 . RiverMamba thus makes an important contribution to climate adaptation and risk prevention—topics that are receiving special attention worldwide, particularly around UN World Tsunami Awareness Day on November 5. The findings are published on the arXiv preprint server. AI learns from environmental and climate data RiverMamba is based on the so-called Mamba architecture, a new generation of deep learning models that can handle temporal and spatial environmental and climate data particularly efficiently. The system continuously evaluates data on precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and flow velocity and recognizes patterns that are decisive for the development of floods. RiverMamba combines the strengths of classic, physics-based models such as the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), which makes global predictions but does not fully model local characteristics. GloFAS is very computationally intensive, with local, learning-based models such as Google\\'s Flood Hub, which is very efficient but can only predict river flows at existing measuring stations. RiverMamba learns both from data from physics-based models and directly from extensive environmental and observational data. This enables it to make reliable predictions even when measurement series are incomplete or missing—for example, in smaller catchment areas or regions with limited data availability. This ability to independently model complex interactions between weather, topography, and runoff behavior opens up new perspectives for more accurate flood forecasts worldwide. The development was led by Prof. Dr. Jürgen Gall, Principal Investigator at the Lamarr Institute, in close collaboration with the Transdisciplinary Research Area \"Modeling,\" the Integrated Research Training Group at the DFG Collaborative Research Center \"DETECT—Regional Climate Change: Disentangling the Role of Land Use and Water Management\" (SFB 1502 DETECT) at the University of Bonn, and the project \"Foundation Model for Weather Forecasting\" (RAINA), a joint project of the University of Bonn, the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), and the Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ). The interdisciplinary project combines AI research with climate modeling, hydrology, and weather forecasting—and shows how research from North Rhine–Westphalia contributes to overcoming global challenges. \"With RiverMamba, we are showing how AI can be used in a targeted manner to model environmental processes more realistically and efficiently,\" says Prof. Dr. Jürgen Gall. \"Such data-based approaches can usefully complement existing early warning systems—an important step toward more reliable forecasts in the face of increasing extreme weather events .\" More information: Mohamad Hakam Shams Eddin et al, RiverMamba: A State Space Model for Global River Discharge and Flood Forecasting, arXiv (2025).

        "reason_identified": "RiverMamba represents a significant advancement in AI-driven flood forecasting that creates both risk mitigation opportunities and emerging exposures for insurers. The technology improves predictive accuracy for river discharge and flood events, particularly in data-sparse regions, enabling earlier warnings and property protection measures. However, insurers face new challenges including: (1) coverage disputes over AI-generated forecast triggers and notice periods; (2) model uncertainty and potential liability if predictions prove inaccurate; (3) regulatory compliance requirements for algorithmic decision-making in claims handling; and (4) the need to integrate third-party AI systems into underwriting and reserve methodologies. The integration of physics-based and machine learning approaches creates both opportunities to reduce claims frequency in flood-prone areas and risks related to algorithmic transparency and accountability in coverage determinations.",

In early June 2024, a significant flood affected Southern Germany. While the top row shows the floods obtained from the GloFAS reanalysis, the bottom row shows the river discharge forecast by our approach. The severity of floods is categorized by the statistical flood return period, i.e., occurring every 10 years. Credit: arXiv (2025).

DOI: 10.1145/3746059.3747759 A new prototype of a knitting machine creates solid, knitted shapes, adding stitches in any direction—forward, backward and diagonal—so users can construct a wide variety of shapes and add stiffness to different parts of the object. Unlike traditional knitting, which yields a 2D sheet of stitches, this proof-of-concept machine—developed by researchers at Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon University—functions more like a 3D printer, building up solid shapes with horizontal layers of stitches. \"We establish that not only can it be done, but because of the way we attach the stitch, it will give us access to a lot of flexibility about how we control the material,\" said François Guimbretière, professor of information science at Cornell. \"The expressiveness is very similar to a 3D printer.\" Guimbretière and co-author Victor Guimbretière, a student at Cornell Engineering, presented the work, \"Using an Array of Needles to Create Solid Knitted Shapes,\" at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in Busan, Korea on Sept. 30. Guimbretière first became interested in solid knitting while tinkering with a knitting machine in the lab of co-author Scott Hudson, professor of human-computer interaction in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, in 2016. A few years later, Guimbretière built the prototype from scratch in his basement during the COVID-19 pandemic, using primarily 3D-printed components. François Guimbretière, professor of information science, and Victor Guimbretière \\'29 developed a knitting machine that functions like a 3D printer—building up horizontal layers of stitches to create solid objects. Credit: Luke Stewart / Cornell University The machine has a bed of knitting needles arranged in a 6x6 block, with each composed of a 3D-printed symmetrical double hook attached to a brass support tube. The front and back parts of the double hook move independently, which allows the machine to knit or purl, depending on which half picks up the first loop. To control the machine, the researchers developed a library of code for each type of stitch, which can generate a program for each product. Because the knitting head that dispenses the yarn can move directly over the array of needles to any location, the design offers excellent flexibility to create complex knitted structures. Previous solid knitting machines lacked this flexibility, which greatly limits the shapes they can produce, researchers said. So far, the team has successfully knitted objects shaped like a C and a pyramid, which demonstrates the machine\\'s ability to create complex shapes and overhangs. Currently, the prototype is still slow, prone to dropping loops and sometimes catches the yarn on the wrong needles, but Guimbretière has plans to make the machine more robust. Additionally, it should be easy to scale up the design, he said, simply by adding a larger bed of needles. With further improvements, this type of approach may be useful for medical applications , such as knitting structures that support the growth of artificial ligaments or veins, Guimbretière said. Solid knitting allows the user to create different levels of thickness and stiffness in the final product, so it may be useful for accurately mimicking biological structures. Amritansh Kwatra, now a Ph.D. student in the field of information science at Cornell Tech, also contributed to the study.

        "reason_identified": "This prototype 3D knitting machine presents emerging product liability exposures given documented operational deficiencies including loop-dropping failures and yarn-catching incidents. The planned medical device applications for artificial ligament and vein fabrication introduce significant regulatory compliance risks under FDA oversight and heightened duty-of-care standards for biomedical equipment manufacturers. The machine's reliance on 3D-printed components and custom-coded stitch libraries creates design defect vulnerabilities, particularly if scaled for commercial production without rigorous quality assurance protocols. Manufacturing hazards exist during operation due to moving needle arrays and yarn tension mechanisms, exposing operators to mechanical injury. The scalability design and current performance limitations suggest inadequate product development maturity, presenting substantial warranty and recall exposure if commercialized prematurely without comprehensive failure mode analysis and field testing.",

Credit: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology A research team led by the School of Engineering of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has made significant advances in quantum rod light-emitting diodes (QR-LEDs), setting record-high efficiency level for red QR-LEDs. This innovation is poised to revolutionize next-generation display and lighting technologies, offering smartphone and television users a vibrant and enhanced visual experience. The research is published in the journal Advanced Materials . LEDs have been widely used in electronic products for decades. Recent developments in quantum materials have given rise to quantum dot LEDs (QD-LEDs) and QR-LEDs. QD-LEDs offer superior color purity (color vividness) and higher brightness compared to current mainstream LEDs. However, outcoupling efficiency has now become the primary obstacle, as it sets a fundamental ceiling for external quantum efficiency (EQE), thereby hindering any further performance improvements. Quantum rods, on which QR-LEDs are based, are a type of elongated anisotropic nanocrystals with unique optical properties that can be engineered to optimize the light emission direction and ultimately improve outcoupling efficiency. However, QR-LEDs encounter two significant technical challenges: first, the ratio of emitted to absorbed photons (photoluminescence quantum yield) is relatively low after the material absorbs photons; second, there is a substantial leakage current due to poor thin-film quality. To address these challenges, a research team led by Prof. Abhishek K. Srivastava, Associate Professor of the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), focused on boosting optical performance of QR-LEDs via refined synthesis engineering. They achieved an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 92% for both green and red quantum rods, along with uniform size distribution and shape confinement, all of which are essential for optimizing QR-LED performance. In previous studies, the carrier leakage caused by irregular quantum rod films and its impact on diminishing the light coupling efficiency of QR-LEDs has often been overlooked. To tackle this issue, the team built an equivalent circuit model that illustrates the detrimental effects of leakage current in traditional QR-LED structures. This model provided valuable insights into the device\\'s operation, enabling the formulation of targeted solutions to suppress current leakage. By strategically transforming the QR-LED device structure, the team achieved a dual breakthrough: simultaneously enhancing balanced carrier injections and suppressing leakage current. The results were remarkable—the optimized red QR-LEDs achieved a peak EQE of 31% and a peak brightness of 110,000 cd m⁻², setting a new record in previous red QR-LED research. Moreover, to validate the universality of their strategies, the team applied the same approach to green \"dot-in-rod\" quantum rods. The green devices also yielded impressive results, reaching a peak EQE of 20.2% and an ultra-high luminance of 250,000 cd m⁻². These outcomes not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the innovations but also highlight their potential for application across different color variants of QR-LEDs. Prof. Srivastava, the corresponding author of the study, remarked, \"Previous QD-LED research primarily focused on optimizing quantum dot structures for high efficiency, but this approach does not apply to elongated shaped quantum rods, such as QR-LED. \"By utilizing equivalent circuit models and quantum rod micromorphology, we revealed that QR-LEDs have widespread pinholes due to their shape, which leads to critical leakage currents—an issue not encountered in tightly packed QD-LEDs. By modifying the device structure, we addressed the quality issues in the emissive layer and verified the fundamental advantages of quantum rods over quantum dots. This work is set to guide research on similar anisotropic nanocrystals and advance their commercial applications.\" More information: Zebing Liao et al, Inverted Device Engineering for Efficient and Bright Quantum Rod LEDs, Advanced Materials (2025).

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain In an era when recent cyberattacks on major telecommunications providers have highlighted the fragility of mobile security, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have identified a class of previously unknown vulnerabilities that could allow remote attackers to compromise cellular networks serving billions of users worldwide. The research team, led by Professor Yongdae Kim of KAIST\\'s School of Electrical Engineering, discovered that unauthorized attackers could remotely manipulate internal user information in LTE core networks—the central infrastructure that manages authentication, internet connectivity, and data transmission for mobile devices and IoT equipment. The findings, presented at the 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security ( ACM CCS 2025 ) in Taipei, Taiwan, earned the team a Distinguished Paper Award. A new class of vulnerability The vulnerability class, which the researchers termed \"Context Integrity Violation\" (CIV), represents a fundamental breach of a basic security principle: unauthenticated messages should not alter internal system states. While previous security research has primarily focused on \"downlink\" attacks—where networks compromise devices—this study examined the less-scrutinized \"uplink\" security, where devices can attack core networks. \"The problem stems from gaps in the 3GPP standards,\" Professor Kim explained, referring to the international body that establishes operational rules for mobile networks. \"While the standards prohibit processing messages that fail authentication, they lack clear guidance on handling messages that bypass authentication procedures entirely.\" The team developed CITesting, the world\\'s first systematic tool for detecting these vulnerabilities, capable of examining between 2,802 and 4,626 test cases —a vast expansion from the 31 cases covered by the only previous comparable research tool, LTEFuzz. Widespread impact confirmed Testing four major LTE core network implementations—both open-source and commercial systems—revealed that all contained CIV vulnerabilities. The results showed: Open5GS: 2,354 detections, 29 unique vulnerabilities srsRAN: 2,604 detections, 22 unique vulnerabilities Amarisoft: 672 detections, 16 unique vulnerabilities Nokia: 2,523 detections, 59 unique vulnerabilities The research team demonstrated three critical attack scenarios: denial of service by corrupting network information to block reconnection; IMSI exposure by forcing devices to retransmit user identification numbers in plaintext; and location tracking by capturing signals during reconnection attempts. Unlike traditional attacks requiring fake base stations or signal interference near victims, these attacks work remotely through legitimate base stations, affecting anyone within the same MME (Mobility Management Entity) coverage area as the attacker—potentially spanning entire metropolitan regions. Industry response and future implications Following responsible disclosure protocols, the research team notified affected vendors. Amarisoft deployed patches, and Open5GS integrated the team\\'s fixes into its official repository. Nokia, however, stated it would not issue patches, asserting compliance with 3GPP standards and declining to comment on whether telecommunications companies currently use the affected equipment. \"Uplink security has been relatively neglected due to testing difficulties, implementation diversity, and regulatory constraints,\" Professor Kim noted. \"Context integrity violations can pose serious security risks.\" The research team, which included KAIST doctoral students Mincheol Son and Kwangmin Kim as co-first authors, along with Beomseok Oh and Professor CheolJun Park of Kyung Hee University, plans to extend their validation to 5G and private 5G environments. The tools could prove particularly critical for industrial and infrastructure networks, where breaches could have consequences ranging from communication disruption to exposure of sensitive military or corporate data. With mobile networks forming the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, the discovery underscores the ongoing challenge of securing systems designed in an era when such sophisticated attacks were barely conceivable—and the urgent need for updated standards to address them.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain Can an AI persona detect when a human is lying—and should we trust it if it can? Artificial intelligence, or AI, has had many recent advances and continues to evolve in scope and capability. A new Michigan State University-led study is diving deeper into how well AI can understand humans by using it to detect human deception. In the study, published in the Journal of Communication , researchers from MSU and the University of Oklahoma conducted 12 experiments with over 19,000 AI participants to examine how well AI personas were able to detect deception and truth from human subjects . \"This research aims to understand how well AI can aid in deception detection and simulate human data in social scientific research, as well as caution professionals when using large language models for lie detection ,\" said David Markowitz, associate professor of communication in the MSU College of Communication Arts and Sciences and lead author of the study. To evaluate AI in comparison to human deception detection, the researchers pulled from Truth–Default Theory (TDT). TDT suggests that people are mostly honest most of the time and we are inclined to believe that others are telling us the truth. This theory helped the researchers compare how AI acts to how people act in the same kinds of situations. \"Humans have a natural truth bias—we generally assume others are being honest, regardless of whether they actually are,\" Markowitz said. \"This tendency is thought to be evolutionarily useful, since constantly doubting everyone would take much effort, make everyday life difficult, and be a strain on relationships.\" To analyze the judgment of AI personas, the researchers used the Viewpoints AI research platform to assign audiovisual or audio-only media of humans for AI to judge. The AI judges were asked to determine if the human subject was lying or telling the truth and provide a rationale. Different variables were evaluated, such as media type (audiovisual or audio-only), contextual background (information or circumstances that help explain why something happens), lie-truth base-rates (proportions of honest and deceptive communication), and the persona of the AI (identities created to act and talk like real people) to see how AI\\'s detection accuracy was impacted. For example, one of the studies found that AI was lie-biased, as AI was much more accurate for lies (85.8%) compared to truths (19.5%). In short interrogation settings, AI\\'s deception accuracy was comparable to that of humans. However, in a non-interrogation setting (e.g., when evaluating statements about friends), AI displayed a truth-bias, aligning more accurately to human performance. Generally, the results found that AI is more lie-biased and much less accurate than humans. \"Our main goal was to see what we could learn about AI by including it as a participant in deception detection experiments. In this study, and with the model we used, AI turned out to be sensitive to context—but that didn\\'t make it better at spotting lies,\" said Markowitz. The final findings suggest that AI\\'s results do not match human results or accuracy and that humanness might be an important limit, or boundary condition, for how deception detection theories apply. The study highlights that using AI for detection may seem unbiased, but the industry needs to make significant progress before generative AI can be used for deception detection. \"It\\'s easy to see why people might want to use AI to spot lies—it seems like a high-tech, potentially fair, and possibly unbiased solution. But our research shows that we\\'re not there yet,\" said Markowitz. \"Both researchers and professionals need to make major improvements before AI can truly handle deception detection .\" More information: David M Markowitz et al, The (in)efficacy of AI personas in deception detection experiments, Journal of Communication (2025).

Their performance varies with context and media type, and their results do not align with human patterns, indicating current AI models are not yet reliable for lie detection applications. Significant advancements are needed before AI can be trusted for this purpose. This summary was automatically generated using LLM.

        "reason_identified": "This article reports on peer-reviewed research demonstrating that current AI models exhibit significant limitations in deception detection, with systematic bias toward lie detection (85.8% accuracy) versus truth detection (19.5% accuracy). The study establishes that AI performance does not replicate human deception detection patterns and is substantially less accurate overall. For insurance organizations, this creates material liability exposure if AI-based deception detection systems are deployed in claims adjudication, fraud investigation, or underwriting decisions without adequate human oversight. The research establishes an emerging industry standard of care that AI deception detection is not yet operationally reliable, exposing early adopters to professional liability claims, regulatory sanctions for unfair claims practices, and potential bad-faith litigation if coverage decisions are based on unreliable AI determinations.",

To evaluate AI in comparison to human deception detection, the researchers pulled from Truth–Default Theory (TDT). TDT suggests that people are mostly honest most of the time and we are inclined to believe that others are telling us the truth. This theory helped the researchers compare how AI acts to how people act in the same kinds of situations. \"Humans have a natural truth bias—we generally assume others are being honest, regardless of whether they actually are,\" Markowitz said. \"This tendency is thought to be evolutionarily useful, since constantly doubting everyone would take much effort, make everyday life difficult, and be a strain on relationships.\" To analyze the judgment of AI personas, the researchers used the Viewpoints AI research platform to assign audiovisual or audio-only media of humans for AI to judge. The AI judges were asked to determine if the human subject was lying or telling the truth and provide a rationale",

Share Tweet Share Email November 4, 2025 The GIST AI in the courtroom: The dangers of using ChatGPT in legal practice in South Africa by Jacques Matthee, Grey Stopforth, The Conversation edited by Stephanie Baum , reviewed by Andrew Zinin Editors\\' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X\\'s editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain A South African court case made headlines for all the wrong reasons in January 2025. The legal team in Mavundla vs. MEC: Department of Co-Operative Government and Traditional Affairs KwaZulu-Natal and Others had relied on case law that simply didn\\'t exist. It had been generated by ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI . Only two of the nine case authorities the legal team submitted to the High Court were genuine. The rest were AI-fabricated \"hallucinations.\" The court called this conduct \" irresponsible and unprofessional \" and referred the matter to the Legal Practice Council, the statutory body that regulates legal practitioners in South Africa, for investigation. It was not the first time South African courts had encountered such an incident. Parker vs. Forsyth in 2023 also dealt with fake case law produced by ChatGPT. But the judge was more forgiving in that instance, finding no intent to mislead. The Mavundla ruling marks a turning point: courts are losing patience with legal practitioners who use AI irresponsibly. We are legal academics who have been doing research on the growing use of AI, particularly generative AI, in legal research and education. While these technologies offer powerful tools for enhancing efficiency and productivity, they also present serious risks when used irresponsibly. Aspiring legal practitioners who misuse AI tools without proper guidance or ethical grounding risk severe professional consequences, even before their careers begin. Law schools should equip students with the skills and judgment to use AI tools responsibly. But most institutions remain unprepared for the pace at which AI is being adopted. Very few universities have formal policies or training on AI. Students are left with no guide through this rapidly evolving terrain. Our work calls for a proactive and structured approach to AI education in law schools. When technology becomes a liability The advocate in the Mavundla case admitted she had not verified the citations and relied instead on research done by a junior colleague. That colleague, a candidate attorney, claimed to have obtained the material from an online research tool. While she denied using ChatGPT, the pattern matched similar global incidents where lawyers unknowingly filed AI-generated judgments. In the 2024 American case of Park vs. Kim , the attorney cited non-existent case law in her reply brief, which she admitted was generated using ChatGPT. In the 2024 Canadian case of Zhang vs. Chen , the lawyer filed a notice of application containing two non-existent case authorities fabricated by ChatGPT. The court in Mavundla was unequivocal: No matter how advanced technology becomes, lawyers remain responsible for ensuring that every source they present is accurate. Workload pressure or ignorance of AI\\'s risks is no defense. The judge also criticized the supervising attorney for failing to check the documents before filing them. The episode underscored a broader ethical principle: Senior lawyers must properly train and supervise junior colleagues. The lesson here extends far beyond one law firm. Integrity, accuracy and critical thinking are not optional extras in the legal profession. They are core values that must be taught and practiced from the beginning, during legal education. The classroom is the first courtroom The Mavundla case should serve as a warning to universities. If experienced legal practitioners can fall into AI traps regarding law, students still learning to research and reason can too. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can be powerful allies—they can summarize cases, draft arguments and analyze complex texts in seconds. But they can also confidently fabricate information. Because AI models don\\'t always \"know\" when they are wrong , they produce text that looks authoritative but may be entirely false. For students, the dangers are twofold. First, over-reliance on AI can stunt the development of critical research skills. Second, it can lead to serious academic or professional misconduct. A student who submits AI-fabricated content could face disciplinary action at university and reputational damage that follows them into their legal career. In our paper we argue that instead of banning AI tools outright, law schools should teach students to use them responsibly. This means developing \"AI literacy\": the ability to question, verify and contextualize AI-generated information. Students should learn to treat AI systems as assistants, not authorities. In South African legal practice, authority traditionally refers to recognized sources such as legislation, judicial precedent and academic commentary, which lawyers cite to support their arguments. These sources are accessed through established legal databases and law reports, a process that, while time-consuming, ensures accuracy, accountability and adherence to the rule of law. From law faculties to courtrooms Legal educators can embed AI literacy into existing courses on research methodology, professional ethics and legal writing. Exercises could include verifying AI-generated summaries against real judgments or analyzing the ethical implications of relying on machine-produced arguments. Teaching responsible AI use is not simply about avoiding embarrassment in court. It is about protecting the integrity of the justice system itself. As seen in Mavundla, one candidate attorney\\'s uncritical use of AI led to professional investigation, public scrutiny and reputational damage to the firm. The financial risks are also real. Courts can order lawyers to pay costs out of their pockets when serious professional misconduct occurs. In the digital era, where court judgments and media reports spread instantly online, a lawyer\\'s reputation can collapse overnight if they are found to have relied on fake or unverified AI material. It would also be beneficial for courts to be trained in detecting fake cases generated by AI. The way forward Our study concludes that AI is here to stay, and so is its use in law. The challenge is not whether the legal profession should use AI, but how. Law schools have a critical opportunity, and an ethical duty, to prepare future practitioners for a world where technology and human judgment must work side by side. Speed and convenience can never replace accuracy and integrity. As AI becomes a routine part of legal research, tomorrow\\'s lawyers must be trained not just to prompt—but to think.

        "chunk_text": ". It was not the first time South African courts had encountered such an incident. Parker vs. Forsyth in 2023 also dealt with fake case law produced by ChatGPT. But the judge was more forgiving in that instance, finding no intent to mislead. The Mavundla ruling marks a turning point: courts are losing patience with legal practitioners who use AI irresponsibly. We are legal academics who have been doing research on the growing use of AI, particularly generative AI, in legal research and education. While these technologies offer powerful tools for enhancing efficiency and productivity, they also present serious risks when used irresponsibly. Aspiring legal practitioners who misuse AI tools without proper guidance or ethical grounding risk severe professional consequences, even before their careers begin. Law schools should equip students with the skills and judgment to use AI tools responsibly. But most institutions remain unprepared for the pace at which AI is being adopted. Very few universities have formal policies or training on AI. Students are left with no guide through this rapidly evolving terrain. Our work calls for a proactive and structured approach to AI education in law schools. When technology becomes a liability The advocate in the Mavundla case admitted she had not verified the citations and relied instead on research done by a junior colleague. That colleague, a candidate attorney, claimed to have obtained the material from an online research tool",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain Danish music rights group Koda said Tuesday that it was suing the American AI music platform Suno, accusing it of training its model for music creation on copyrighted songs. Koda said Suno had \"trained their AI model on Koda\\'s repertoire while concealing the scope and sources of the training data—failing to disclose what works were used and how.\" The group, which represents around 51,000 composers, authors and publishers, said it had evidence of the use of songs from famous Danish acts like Aqua and MØ among others. \"In all cases, Koda has concrete evidence that the copyright of each work has been infringed,\" the group said. It added that the music produced by Suno could mimic the originals, \"putting them in direct competition with the very works exploited.\" \"We are excited about what responsible AI can do for music,\" Koda\\'s chief Gorm Arildsen said. \"But innovation can\\'t be built on stolen goods.\" AI firms from industry leader OpenAI to music specialists like Udio and Suno have been accused by major record companies of using their songs to train artificial intelligence models to produce music. Rights holders have demanded stricter limits on the AI developers\\' activities, including transparency on what source material they have used and guarantees for their revenue. The Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group, filed a lawsuit in June 2024 against both Udio and Suno. AI firms often argue their work is covered by the American copyright loophole of \"fair use,\" which does not require rights holders\\' consent. Negotiations have also been initiated between the three major labels—Universal, Warner and Sony—and AI companies. Universal and Udio on October 30 announced an agreement to launch a music creation platform in 2026. Koda said it was also calling for \"a clear, industry-wide standard\" for demanding consent from creators, transparency and remuneration from tech companies . According to Koda, at the current pace of AI development it could lead to a \"historic\" 28% revenue loss for the Danish music industry by 2030. © 2025 AFP Citation : Danish music rights group sues AI music platform Suno (2025, November 4) retrieved 5 November 2025 from https://techxplore.com/news/2025-11-danish-music-rights-group-sues.html This document is subject to copyright.

        "reason_identified": "Koda's copyright infringement lawsuit against Suno presents substantial intellectual property liability exposure, alleging unauthorized use of protected musical compositions for AI model training without consent or transparency regarding training data sources. The case establishes precedent for stricter liability standards across multiple jurisdictions (Denmark, US, Germany), potentially eliminating the 'fair use' defense currently relied upon by AI developers. Financial exposure extends beyond direct litigation costs to include potential damages, mandatory licensing agreements, and revenue restitution claims. Koda projects 28% industry revenue loss by 2030 if current practices continue, driving regulatory pressure for industry-wide standards on creator consent, data transparency, and remuneration. The documented breach of disclosure obligations and absence of consent mechanisms create documented breach-of-contract and unjust enrichment exposures. Business interruption risk is elevated given potential for injunctive relief restricting model training or output distribution pending litigation resolution.",

Share Tweet Share Email November 4, 2025 The GIST Getty Images largely loses lawsuit against UK AI firm edited by Andrew Zinin Editors\\' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X\\'s editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread US media company Getty Images largely lost a case it brought against a British AI firm over use of its copyrighted content without permission, a court in London said on Tuesday. Getty had alleged that London-based Stability AI, whose directors include Canadian filmmaker James Cameron, \"extracted millions\" of images from Getty\\'s websites \"without consent\" to unlawfully train its deep learning AI model, Stable Diffusion. The model can generate images using verbal commands. Stability AI rejected the claim, telling a High Court trial which began in June, that the legal action was a \"threat\" to the business. Getty, which distributes stock and news photos and videos, including AFP photos, dropped its allegations of breach of copyright during the trial but continued to pursue several other claims, including trademark infringement and secondary infringement of copyright. Getty acknowledged that there was \"no evidence that the training and development of Stable Diffusion took place in the United Kingdom,\" judge Joanna Smith said in a 205-page ruling on Tuesday. \"This court can only determine the issues that arise on the (diminished) case that remains before it,\" her ruling said. Stability AI was found responsible for producing images on which the watermark \"Getty\" or the subsidiary name \"iStock\" appeared, a partial win in its trademark infringement claim. \"In summary, although Getty Images succeed (in part) in their Trade Mark Infringement Claim, my findings are both historic and extremely limited in scope,\" Smith also wrote. The ruling is likely to be seen as a blow for content creators and copyright owners globally at a time of unease over how they can be fairly compensated should AI models use their work. \"We remain deeply concerned that even well-funded companies like Getty Images face significant challenges in protecting their works,\" Getty said in a statement. \"We call on governments, including the United Kingdom, to establish stricter transparency rules.\" Christian Dowell, general counsel for Stability AI, said the company was \"pleased\" with the court\\'s ruling. \"Getty\\'s decision to voluntarily dismiss most of its copyright claims at the conclusion of trial testimony left only a subset of claims before the court, and this final ruling ultimately resolves the copyright concerns that were the core issue,\" he said in a statement. © 2025 AFP Citation : Getty Images largely loses lawsuit against UK AI firm (2025, November 4) retrieved 5 November 2025 from https://techxplore.com/news/2025-11-getty-images-largely-lawsuit-uk.html This document is subject to copyright.

        "reason_identified": "Getty Images' substantial litigation loss against Stability AI establishes unfavorable legal precedent for intellectual property enforcement in AI contexts. The court's dismissal of primary copyright claims and narrow trademark-only ruling creates significant gaps in IP protection mechanisms for content creators. The ruling highlights territorial jurisdiction limitations, as the court found no evidence that Stable Diffusion training occurred in the UK, restricting Getty's legal recourse. This decision elevates regulatory compliance risk as governments face pressure to establish AI transparency mandates. The case exposes multinational media companies to elevated cyber liability and IP infringement risks, with reduced recovery prospects for content owners. Underwriters should reassess coverage adequacy for digital asset protection and IP defense costs in the rapidly evolving AI sector.",

DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-65105-3 More than 40% of existing and planned offshore wind farm sites in Europe and Asia are being exposed to wind speeds above the maximum design load of some classes of turbine, according to a study in Nature Communications . These findings highlight the need for better adaptation of offshore wind energy infrastructure to increase resilience to extreme wind events associated with climate change. Offshore wind energy is a key component of the global transition to renewable energy . Offshore wind farms must be able to endure challenging environments and are built with different maximum wind speed design loads depending on their class (Class III having the lowest limit, followed by Class II and Class I having the highest limit). Recent research has suggested that extreme wind events are becoming more intense due to global climate change, raising the question of whether existing and planned projects are equipped for this additional stress. Yanan Zhao and colleagues analyzed hourly wind speed data from between 1940 and 2023 across global oceans. They found extreme wind speeds increased in approximately 63% of oceanic coastal regions, often associated with weather system changes under global warming .

Credit: Nature Communications (2025). DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-65105-3 The authors found that more than 40% of both commissioned and planned offshore farms in Asia and Europe have encountered wind speeds exceeding the current design load for Class III turbines (designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 37.5 meters per second). More than half of these wind farms are situated in regions with increasing extreme wind trends, a pattern which the authors suggest is associated with changes to cyclone activity under global warming. The findings of this study underscore the need to adapt and protect wind energy infrastructure from intensifying extreme winds associated with continued climate change.

Extreme wind speeds have increased in about 63% of coastal regions, highlighting the need for improved infrastructure resilience to withstand intensifying wind events linked to climate change.

Recent research has suggested that extreme wind events are becoming more intense due to global climate change, raising the question of whether existing and planned projects are equipped for this additional stress. Yanan Zhao and colleagues analyzed hourly wind speed data from between 1940 and 2023 across global oceans. They found extreme wind speeds increased in approximately 63% of oceanic coastal regions, often associated with weather system changes under global warming .

Credit: Nature Communications (2025). DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-65105-3 The authors found that more than 40% of both commissioned and planned offshore farms in Asia and Europe have encountered wind speeds exceeding the current design load for Class III turbines (designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 37.5 meters per second). More than half of these wind farms are situated in regions with increasing extreme wind trends, a pattern which the authors suggest is associated with changes to cyclone activity under global warming",
